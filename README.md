### Currently researching a job or a company that would hire me for one year for a work-based training. To see my other projects, [I have a portfolio][website]

I was able to learn new technologies like mongoDB, a payment API (Stripe), typescript and hooks with react. It required lots of research on the internet in order to comprehend the full extent of each technology.
