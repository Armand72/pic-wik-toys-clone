## Welcome to the pic-wik-toys-clone project

I was able to to train with this project on new technologies like mongoDB, a payment API (Stripe), typescript and hooks with react.

### Currently researching a job or a company that would hire me for one year for a work-based training. To see my other projects, [I have a portfolio][website]
